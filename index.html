        <h1>What can CitiBike ebike data tell us about NYC's transit gaps?</h1>
        <p>Citi Bike launched <a href='https://ride.citibikenyc.com/blog/new-york-meet-your-new-ebike' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new ebikes</a> on May 5, 2022 that made it even easier for able-bodied New Yorkers to speed around town. In some cases, these riders may be choosing ebikes because they are preferable to their public transit options. Through this map, you can compare the routes ebikers took between 9 to 10am on March 6, 2023 against current MTA subway and bus routes. <b>Can you spot routes that people prefer to ebike over taking the train or bus?</b></p>

        <!-- between March 6, 2023 and March 12, 2023 -->

            <p><b style="color: #fa1400;">Red lines</b> show the potential routes ebikers took. These lines are transparent, so the thicker the line, the more popular the route. Ebike trip data is from <a href='https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citi Bike</a>.</p>
            <p><b style="color: #005ea1;">Blue lines</b> show MTA subway and bus routes. Subway routes are solid and bus route are dashed. Routes are sourced from the <a href='https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/confluence/display/geoportal/NYC+Mass+Transit+Spatial+Layers' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baruch College Geoportal's NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layers</a>.</p>
