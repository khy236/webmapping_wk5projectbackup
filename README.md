# Interactive map of ebike trips vs MTA subway and bus routes

Citi Bike launched [new Ebikes](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/blog/new-york-meet-your-new-ebike) on May 5, 2022 that make it easy for able-bodied New Yorkers to speed around town. In some cases, these riders may be choosing ebikes because they are preferable to their public transit options. Through this map, you can compare the routes ebikers took and current MTA subway and bus routes. Can you spot routes that ebikes cover but the MTA does not?

Green lines show the potential routes bikers took. Ebike trip data is from [Citi Bike](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html). Routes are estimated using MapBox's [Directions API](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/navigation/directions/).

Blue lines show MTA subway and bus routes. Subway routes are solid and bus route are dashed. Routes are sourced from the Baruch College Geoportal's NYC Mass Transit Spatial Layers](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/confluence/display/geoportal/NYC+Mass+Transit+Spatial+Layers').
